17. Paste the assignment repository URL in the URL field and make sure to select the directory in which the assignment will sit.  IntelliJ will add the name of the repo to the Directory path.  If it does not, please add the name of the assignment directory.  For example, if the directory is <span style="color:blue;">C:\Users\JohnSmith\Documents</span>, make sure to add the name of the assignment.  In my case, this should be changed to <span style="color:blue;">C:\Users\JohnSmith\Documents\recitation0</span>  <p></p><strong>Click the link to download and install Git, if asked.</strong><p><span style="color:red;"><strong>WARNING:</strong>  If you do not add a folder name, IntelliJ will put all the project files in the Documents folder</span>.</p>
18. Press the Clone button. IntelliJ will create the folder for you and place the assignment code in the csci-1210Recitation0 folder under the Documents folder.
19. Your workspace should now look like the image shown below.<p/><image src="./Instructions/xstep19.png"></p>
20. Now, to run and test the provided Java code, you will need to create a run configuration. Click on the run configuration button, as shown in the image below.<p/><image src="./Instructions/xstep20.png" height="400"></p>
